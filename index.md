I am Muhammad Yaseen, currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Gaditek](http://www.gaditek.com) - a Cyber Security company. I did my Bachelors in Computer and Information Systems Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Pakistan.

## Research Interests

My chief interest is in designing intelligent systems that are capable of learning and adaptation. I study algorithms that learn from structured and unstructured data, environment, labeled examples, expert behavior in an attempt to act in an artificially intelligent way. I have also worked on developing Big Data and ML pipelines and software infrastructure for Machine Learning.

This internship was part of Smart Agriculture project collaboration between NED University (Pakistan) and DFKI (Germany). During this internship I learned how AI and ML is being used at DFKI to solve many different problems in fields like agriculture, farming, smart books/learning, document understanding and segmentation.

<img style="width: 340px; height: 255px;" src="./images/me_kl.jpg">

As part of my project study, I gave following 2 presentations:

[Commercial and Research Landscape for Smart Irrigation Systems](https://www.slideshare.net/MuhammadYaseenAftab1/commercial-research-landscape-for-smart-irrigation-systems) - Presented as part of an initial project study at DFKI.

[Smart Irrigation Systems - Hardware Architecture](https://www.slideshare.net/MuhammadYaseenAftab1/smart-irrigation-system-hardware-architecture-for-warm-project) - A presentation I gave at 10th Workshop on Field and Assistive Robotics [(WFAR 10)](https://agrosy.informatik.uni-kl.de/en/conferences/wfar/wfar10/) at Schloss Dagstuhl in Wadern, Germany.

Supervisor: Dr. Muhammad Khurram ([NED UET](http://www.neduet.edu.pk/cise/mkhurram.html) / [RCAI](http://rcai.pk/ResearchCenterAI/ourteam/director.html))

I was among the first members of newly formed RCAI established at NED University. At RCAI I worked mainly on projects leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

* **Smart Agriculture** [(Project Link)](http://rcai.pk/ResearchCenterAI/project/pp1.html): In this German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) funded project, as part of hardware design team I worked on several prototypes based on different Arduino and custom boards. (weblink)
* **Smart Warehouse** [(Project Link)](http://rcai.pk/ResearchCenterAI/project/p4.html): In this project I worked on a device which helps warehouse workers avoid accidental injury-causing encounters with automated heavy-machinery and tools. My work included writing code **C/C++** for hardware interfacing.

[Blog Post](https://yaseenx.wordpress.com/2016/06/11/presenting-my-paper-at-1st-ieec-conference/) about project

Project presentation: [A Smart Safety Gadget for Avoiding Accidents in Warehouse Environment](https://www.slideshare.net/MuhammadYaseenAftab1/a-smart-safety-gadget-for-avoiding-accidents-in-warehouse-environment)

* **Oximeter** [(Project Link)](http://rcai.pk/ResearchCenterAI/project/p8.html): In this project I worked on a Bluetooth enabled low-power oximeter which measures blood-oxygen level and heart rate. My responsibilities included writing code in **C/C++** for interfacing the hardware components. I also developed an Android app **Java** for operating device via smartphone.

Achievements:

* Deployment of company's first Apache Spark cluster
* Deployment of company's first Apache Hadoop cluster
* Architecting company's first Machine Learning pipeline

Problems I have worked with:

* Customer churn
Identifying the reasons of churn
Support marketing teams in designing targeted campaigns based on data driven insights
Predict customers that are more likely to churn
A consistent and company-wide accepted measure of churn.

* Infrastructure health, and capacity planning
In this project I worked on development and deployment of data ingestion and storage pipeline. Collection and robust, scalable storage of machine generated metrics of a global network. The data was then used for monitoring the health of global IT infrastructure. Aid in scheduled load and capacity planning. This also reduced the manual effort of gathering data and compiling hefty reports, and increased accuracy and visibility.
