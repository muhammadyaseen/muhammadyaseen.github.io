## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="yaseen.jpg">

Hello! I am Muhammad Yaseen, currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [PureVPN](http://www.purevpn.com) - a Cyber Security company (via [Disrupt](http://www.disrupt.com/platform)). I did my bachelors in Computer and Information Systems Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi.

This page is my online resume. Here you can find information about my academic and professional interests, as well as a brief summary of my past and current work, and research experience.

## Academic and Professional Interest

My chief interest is in architecting intelligent data-driven systems that are capable of learning and adaptation. I work on industry scale systems that use Big Data to power various Machine Learning (ML) applications. I have worked on Big Data and ML pipelines, starting from the data collection phase and ending at deployment and testing in the wild.

## Work Experience


### PureVPN (via Disrupt Ventures)

<span class="jobposition">Machine Learning Engineer (Dec. 2016 - Present)</span>

---
Achievements:

* Deployment of company's first Apache Spark cluster

* Deployment of company's first Apache Hadoop cluster

* Architecting company's first Machine Learning pipeline

Problems I have worked with:

* Customer churn 
Indentifying the reasons of churn
Support marketing teams in designing targeted campaigns based on data driven insights
Predict customers that are more likely to churn
A consistent and company-wide accepted measure of churn.


* Infrastructure health, and capacity planning

In this project I worked on development and deployement of data ingestion and storage pipeline. Collection and robust, scalable storage of machine generated metrics of a global network. The data was then used for monitoring the health of global IT infrastructure. Aid in scheduled load and capacity planning. This also reduced the manual effort of gathering data and compiling hefty reports, and increased accuracy and visibility.
