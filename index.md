I am Muhammad Yaseen, currently studying MS Computer Science at Saarland University. I have also been awarded Internation Max Plank Research Scholarship by Max-Plank Institüt für Informatik. In the past I have worked as Machine Learning Engineer at [Gaditek](http://www.gaditek.com) - a Cyber Security company. I did my Bachelors in Computer and Information Systems Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Pakistan.

## Academic Interests

I like to study information processing systems that are capable of learning, adaptation, and reasoning from structured or unstructured data, environment, labeled examples, and expert demonstration. I have also worked on developing software infrastructure for Big Data and Machine Learning pipelines.

This internship was part of Smart Agriculture project collaboration between NED University (Pakistan) and DFKI (Germany). During this internship I learned how AI and ML is being used at DFKI to solve many different problems in fields like agriculture, farming, smart books/learning, document understanding and segmentation.

<img style="width: 340px; height: 255px;" src="./images/me_kl.jpg">

As part of my project study, I gave following 2 presentations:

[Commercial and Research Landscape for Smart Irrigation Systems](https://www.slideshare.net/MuhammadYaseenAftab1/commercial-research-landscape-for-smart-irrigation-systems) - Presented as part of an initial project study at DFKI.

[Smart Irrigation Systems - Hardware Architecture](https://www.slideshare.net/MuhammadYaseenAftab1/smart-irrigation-system-hardware-architecture-for-warm-project) - A presentation I gave at 10th Workshop on Field and Assistive Robotics [(WFAR 10)](https://agrosy.informatik.uni-kl.de/en/conferences/wfar/wfar10/) at Schloss Dagstuhl in Wadern, Germany.

Supervisor: Dr. Muhammad Khurram ([NED UET](https://cis.neduet.edu.pk/mkhurram)

At RCAI I worked mainly on projects leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

* **Smart Agriculture**: In this German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) funded project, as part of hardware design team I worked on several prototypes based on different Arduino and custom boards. (weblink)
* **Smart Warehouse**: In this project I worked on a device which helps warehouse workers avoid accidental injury-causing encounters with automated heavy-machinery and tools. My work included writing code **C/C++** for hardware interfacing.

[Blog Post](https://yaseenx.wordpress.com/2016/06/11/presenting-my-paper-at-1st-ieec-conference/) about project

Project presentation: [A Smart Safety Gadget for Avoiding Accidents in Warehouse Environment](https://www.slideshare.net/MuhammadYaseenAftab1/a-smart-safety-gadget-for-avoiding-accidents-in-warehouse-environment)

* **Oximeter**: In this project I worked on a Bluetooth enabled low-power oximeter which measures blood-oxygen level and heart rate. My responsibilities included writing code in **C/C++** for interfacing the hardware components. I also developed an Android app **Java** for operating device via smartphone.

Achievements:

* Deployment of company's first Apache Spark cluster
* Deployment of company's first Apache Hadoop cluster
* Architecting company's first Machine Learning pipeline

Problems I have worked with:

* Customer churn
Identifying the reasons of churn
Support marketing teams in designing targeted campaigns based on data driven insights
Predict customers that are more likely to churn
A consistent and company-wide accepted measure of churn.

* Infrastructure health, and capacity planning
In this project I worked on development and deployment of data ingestion and storage pipeline. Collection and robust, scalable storage of machine generated metrics of a global network. The data was then used for monitoring the health of global IT infrastructure. Aid in scheduled load and capacity planning. This also reduced the manual effort of gathering data and compiling hefty reports, and increased accuracy and visibility.
