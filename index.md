Hello! I am Muhammad Yaseen, currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [PureVPN](http://www.purevpn.com) - a Cyber Security company (via [Disrupt](http://www.disrupt.com/platform)). I did my bachelors in Computer and Information Systems Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi.

## Research Interests

My chief interest is in architecting intelligent data-driven systems that are capable of learning and adaptation. I work on industry scale systems that use Big Data to power various Machine Learning (ML) applications. I have worked on Big Data and ML pipelines, starting from the data collection phase and ending at deployment and testing in the wild.

Achievements:

* Deployment of company's first Apache Spark cluster
* Deployment of company's first Apache Hadoop cluster
* Architecting company's first Machine Learning pipeline

Problems I have worked with:

* Customer churn
Identifying the reasons of churn
Support marketing teams in designing targeted campaigns based on data driven insights
Predict customers that are more likely to churn
A consistent and company-wide accepted measure of churn.

* Infrastructure health, and capacity planning
In this project I worked on development and deployment of data ingestion and storage pipeline. Collection and robust, scalable storage of machine generated metrics of a global network. The data was then used for monitoring the health of global IT infrastructure. Aid in scheduled load and capacity planning. This also reduced the manual effort of gathering data and compiling hefty reports, and increased accuracy and visibility.
