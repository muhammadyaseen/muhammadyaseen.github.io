## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="yaseen.jpg">

Hello! I am Muhammad Yaseen, currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer for [PureVPN](http://www.purevpn.com) - a Cyber Security company (via [Disrupt](http://www.disrupt.com/platform)). I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer and Information Systems from NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi.

This page is my online resume. Here you can find information about my academic and professional interests, as well as a brief summary of my past and current work, and research experience.

## Research Interest

I want to build intelligent systems that are capable of learning and adaptation. I work on industry scale systems powered by Machine Learning algorithms, leveraging the potential of Big Data. I have worked on ML pipelines, starting from the data gathering and enrichment phase and ending at deploying and testing in the wild.
ML works at intersection of many fields. It works as a problem solving tools for many different domains of science and engineering. Hence, Following is a list of wide ranging topics I am interested in:

I want to expore how ML algorithms can be applied on real world datasets with very real , practical real world limitations.

I want to expore how large scale ML applications can be deployed in a robust fashion.

I want to expore how the interplay between big data and ML

I want to expore how generalization works for ML

I want to expore how ML can help in robotics locomotion, learning and decisiopn making

I want to expore ML theory and new learning algorithms and scaling issues.

I want to expore how end-to-end learning is possible with deep learning 

Here is a table

Customer churn

Customer attrition or churn is an important problem for virtually any services industry, not just software. 
Indentifying the reasons of churn
Support marketing teams in designing targeted campaigns based on data driven insights
Predict customers that are more likely to churn
A consistent and company-wide accepted measure of churn.


Infrastructure health, and capacity planning

Infrastructure is the backbone of any software services company. Intelligent planning and monitoring. Proactive, rather than reactive measure are required to address issues in infrastructure. Similarly, companies can benefit both financially and user-experience wise if the infrastructure planning is data driven, based on clearly defined and consistent metrics. In other words, metrics, rather than speculation should be the norm.

In this project I worked on development and deployement of Data ingestion and storage pipeline. Collection and robust, scalable storage of machine generated metrics of a global network.

The data was then used for monitoring the health of system. Aid in scheduled load and capacity planning. This also reduced the manual effort of gathering data and compiling hefty reports, and increased accuracy and visibily.


Improving user experience through intelligent allocation of infrastructure

Manual routing rules quickly become obsolete and the search space is too big to manually trace and identify the best cases. That's why we took an intelligent learning approach to the problem. 
The aim is to improve user experience by assigning the best possible infrastructure resource
